# Multilingual-Braille
Multilingual Braille and Voice Translation Model for Visually Impaired Learners
This project focuses on developing a multilingual Braille and voice translation model to assist visually impaired learners in accessing educational content. The system is designed to:

Translate Text to Braille: Converts printed or digital text into Braille format for tactile reading.
Voice Assistance: Provides real-time voice translation for various languages, enabling accessible learning.
Multilingual Support: Supports multiple languages to cater to diverse learners.
AI-Powered Accuracy: Uses deep learning techniques to improve translation quality.
Real-Time Processing: Ensures fast and efficient text-to-speech and text-to-Braille conversion.
Technologies Used:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for multilingual translation
Text-to-Speech (TTS) for voice output
Braille Encoding Algorithms for accurate tactile representation
Machine Learning for adaptive learning and error correction
Applications:
Assists visually impaired students in education
Enhances accessibility in libraries and online learning platforms
Supports communication in multilingual environments
This project aims to bridge the accessibility gap by integrating AI with assistive technologies for a more inclusive learning experience.
